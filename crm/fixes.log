21-Oct-2016 - Fix 'Lead'/'Send Infopack' so that the task is automaticly 'Assigned To' Christine Appleyard

Modified these files:
./custom/Extension/modules/Tasks/Ext/Vardefs/set_default_value.php
(forces Christine Appleyard and her ID)

./custom/modules/Tasks/metadata/quickcreatedefs.php
(suppresses the "Assign To" selection/delete buttons and makes it Read Only)

The original hack was in the 'cache' directory... which is overwritten whenever things are rebuilt!!!
I Found a saved copy of the file here: crm/custom/modules/Tasks/form_SubpanelQuickCreate_Tasks.tpl
However, this copy is never used by SugarCRM (It's a huge HACK!)

There are still some hacks in the .tpl file that I have't figured out yet, but the SIP stuff seems to work OK now.
